# _School_District_Analysis_

## **Overview of the school district analysis**

The school board reached out to say that the 9th grade math and reading scores from Thomas High School (THS) appeared to have been altered in the file we used in the school district analysis. They then asked us to replace those scores with NaNs and then repeat the school district analysis. Finally, they wanted us to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## **Results**

- **District Summary Changes**
  - Changes to the district summary were fairly insignificant because 9th graders at THS only represented 1.2% of the district (461 of 39,170). For example, the percentage of students who passed math, reading, and both subjects only changed between 0.1 to 0.3%.
    - Old: Passing Math % = 75.0%; Passing Reading % = 85.8%; Passing Both = 65.2%
    - New: Passing Math % = 74.8%; Passing Reading % = 85.7%; Passing Both = 64.9%
  
- **School Summary Changes**
  - Conversely, changes to the school summary were much more pronounced, as 9th graders at THS represented 28.2% of the school (461 of 1,635). For example, removing 9th graders scores at THS significantly improved the percentage of students who passed math, reading, and both subjects. 
    - Old: Passing Math % = 66.9%; Passing Reading % = 69.7%; Passing Both = 65.1%
    - New: Passing Math % = 93.2%; Passing Reading % = 97.0%; Passing Both = 90.6%
    
- **Changes in THS performance relative to other schools**
  - Changes to the data greatly increased the performance of THS relative to other schools. Specifically, the percentage of students who passed math, reading, and both subjects all improved the relative ranking of THS compared to the other 14 schools. 
    - Old rank: Passing Math % = 9th; Passing Reading % = 15th; Passing Both = 8th
    - New Rank: Passing Math % = 7th; Passing Reading % = 3rd; Passing Both = 2nd
    
- **Replacing the ninth-grade scores also affects the following:**

  - Math and reading scores by grade: 
  
  - Scores by school spending: 
  
  - Scores by school size: 
  
  - Scores by school type:
